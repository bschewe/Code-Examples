You guys have really outdone yourselves with this whole '14 Billboard Nominations' situation we've got going on here...

Media, when you say "Lorde &amp; Taylor are fighting"-by fighting do you mean "FaceTiming constantly from US to NZ and LOLing at you"? Thnx bye

@ChrisCarrabba, I'll never be able to thank you enough for showing up to surprise Abigail. Thank you for caring so much about your fans.
